# Module 6 Challenge: APIs  
  
## About
In this challenge, I generated a list of cities using random geographic locations. In WeatherPy.ipynb, I used data from openweathermap.org to identify weather properties. I split the data into two dataframes: northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. I then graphed the dataframes and discussed the linear relationships. In VacationPy.ipynb, I used the list of cities created in WeatherPy.ipynb. I reduced the list to cities that fit my ideal weather conditions and identified hotels that I could stay at if I visited the locations using geoapify.
